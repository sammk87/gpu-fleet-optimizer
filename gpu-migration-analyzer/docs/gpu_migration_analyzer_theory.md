# AWS GPU Instance Price/Performance Migration Analysis Formula

## Core Price/Performance Metrics

### 1. Training Price/Performance Formula

**Training Efficiency Score = (Compute Power × Memory Efficiency × Interconnect Factor) / Hourly Cost**

Where:

- **Compute Power** = Peak FP16 TFLOPS per GPU
- **Memory Efficiency** = (GPU Memory GB / Model Size GB) × Memory Bandwidth Factor
- **Interconnect Factor** = Multiplier based on GPU-to-GPU communication capability
- **Hourly Cost** = On-demand or spot price per hour

#### Interconnect Multipliers:

- **NVSwitch (P-series)**: 1.0 (baseline for multi-GPU workloads)
- **NVLink (G6e)**: 0.7 (some degradation vs full NVSwitch)
- **PCIe Only (G4dn, G5, G6)**: 0.3 (significant bottleneck for multi-GPU)

#### Memory Bandwidth Factors:

- **HBM3e (H200, B200)**: 1.0
- **HBM3 (H100)**: 0.9
- **HBM2e (A100-80GB)**: 0.7
- **HBM2 (A100-40GB)**: 0.6
- **GDDR6 (L4, A10G, T4)**: 0.4

### 2. Inference Price/Performance Formula

**Inference Efficiency Score = (Tokens/Second × Batch Capacity) / Hourly Cost**

Where:

- **Tokens/Second** = Estimated throughput for target model size
- **Batch Capacity** = (GPU Memory - Model Memory) / Context Window Memory
- **Hourly Cost** = Instance cost per hour

### 3. Migration ROI Calculator

**Migration ROI = ((Current Cost/Unit - New Cost/Unit) × Annual Volume) - Migration Costs**

## Practical Migration Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Baseline Current P5 Performance

```
P5 H100 Baseline:
- Compute: 2,000 TFLOPS FP16
- Memory: 80GB HBM3
- Interconnect: NVSwitch (900 GB/s)
- Cost: ~$5.50/hour per GPU (spot: ~$1.75/hour)
```

### Step 2: Calculate Relative Performance Scores

#### For Training Workloads:

```
Performance Score = (New GPU TFLOPS / 2000) × 
                   (New GPU Memory / 80) × 
                   Interconnect Factor × 
                   (P5 Cost / New GPU Cost)
```

#### For Inference Workloads:

```
Performance Score = (New Tokens/sec / H100 Tokens/sec) × 
                   (New Batch Capacity / H100 Batch Capacity) × 
                   (P5 Cost / New GPU Cost)
```

### Step 3: Migration Scenarios Analysis

#### Scenario A: Cost Optimization (Lower Operating Costs)

**Target:** Reduce hourly spend while maintaining similar performance

**Candidates:**

- **G6 (L4)**: 120 TFLOPS, 24GB, $1.32/hr
- **G5 (A10G)**: 31 TFLOPS, 24GB, $1.62/hr

**Formula:**

```
Cost Reduction = (P5 Cost - New Cost) × Hours/Month × GPU Count
Performance Trade-off = New Performance Score / 1.0
```

#### Scenario B: Performance Upgrade (Better Speed/Quality)

**Target:** Improve training/inference speed for same or lower cost per unit of work

**Candidates:**

- **P6 (B200)**: 4,500 TFLOPS, 192GB, ~$7-8/hr (estimated)
- **P5e (H200)**: 2,000 TFLOPS, 141GB, ~$6/hr

**Formula:**

```
Performance Gain = New Performance Score - 1.0
Time Savings = 1 - (1 / Performance Multiplier)
Cost per Unit Work = New Hourly Cost / (P5 Throughput × Performance Multiplier)
```

## Model-Specific Migration Guidelines

### Small Models (7-13B Parameters)

**Current P5 Usage:** Likely underutilized **Migration Target:** G6 (L4) or G5 (A10G)

## Migration Decision Matrix

|Current Setup|Workload Type|Best Migration Target|Expected ROI|Risk Level|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|P5 H100 (Single)|Small Model Inference|G6 L4|75% cost reduction|Low|
|P5 H100 (2-4 GPUs)|Medium Model Training|P6 B200|40% efficiency gain|Medium|
|P5 H100 (8 GPUs)|Large Model Training|P6 B200 Cluster|50% time savings|Medium|
|P5 H100 (Multi-node)|Massive Training|P6 UltraCluster|60% cost/performance|High|

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Migration:

1. **Benchmark current workload**: Measure tokens/second, GPU utilization, memory usage
2. **Calculate baseline costs**: Include instance costs, storage, networking
3. **Test compatibility**: Verify CUDA version, framework support for target GPU
4. **Capacity planning**: Check regional availability of target instances

### During Migration:

1. **Parallel testing**: Run same workload on both instances to validate performance
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Optimize batch size, learning rate for new hardware
3. **Monitor efficiency**: Track actual vs. theoretical performance gains
4. **Cost tracking**: Use detailed billing to confirm expected savings

### Success Metrics:

- **Training**: Cost per training token, time to convergence
- **Inference**: Cost per output token, latency at target QPS
- **Overall**: Total monthly AI infrastructure cost, model quality metrics

## Key Considerations for P5 Migration

1. **Memory-bound vs Compute-bound**: H100s excel in both, so migration targets should match your bottleneck
2. **Batch size optimization**: Newer GPUs often benefit from larger batch sizes
3. **Precision support**: Leverage FP8 on H100/B200 for additional speedup
4. **Spot availability**: Factor in spot instance availability for cost projections
5. **Regional constraints**: Ensure target instances available in required regions

## Example ROI Calculation

**Scenario**: Fine-tuning 70B model currently on 4× P5 H100

```
Current Cost: 4 × $5.50/hr × 100 hours = $2,200 per training run
Target: 2× P6 B200 at $7/hr × 50 hours = $700 per training run
Savings: $1,500 per training run (68% reduction)
Additional Benefits: 2× faster iteration, 2.4× more memory for larger models
```
